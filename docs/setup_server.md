TODO - Tutorial on how to setup a raspberry pi running nothing but an armbian command line
how to install everything youd need on the armbian raspberry pi
clone the repo, setup the server
set the server to start when the raspberry pi starts
make it so you dont have to login to use and enter the raspberry pi
setup a custom hostname like Jukebox.local so the frontend can be used from jukebox.local:3000
